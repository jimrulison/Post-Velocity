Hey James, Quick input needed :
Ah! I see the issue. Craco is looking for its configuration file, but we didn't upload the craco.config.js file during our manual process. We need to add the missing configuration files.

ðŸ”§ MISSING CONFIGURATION FILES - LET'S ADD THEM:
File 11: craco.config.js
Go to your repository: https://github.com/jimrulison/Post-Velocity
Click "Create new file"
Filename: craco.config.js
Copy and paste this content:
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  style: {
    postcss: {
      plugins: [
        require('tailwindcss'),
        require('autoprefixer'),
      ],
    },
  },
  webpack: {
    configure: (webpackConfig) => {
      // Custom webpack configurations can go here
      return webpackConfig;
    },
  },
};
